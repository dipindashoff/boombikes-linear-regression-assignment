# Bike-sharing provider wants to improve its revenue post lockdown
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes who has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic wants to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market after this ongoing quarantine situation ends.
## Business Goal: 
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
